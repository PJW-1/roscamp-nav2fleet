"""Free-floor on the real arena, fourth layout (v4, 2026-11-10 night: 1.98 x 0.99 m, four objects,
map built from the lidar scans of the 07d7 Pinky). The stations stand where the user set them for
v3 (outbound before the middle of the west wall, the work dock in the south-east corner, waiting
in the north-east) and the way round is the figure eight the user asked for: the middle passage
is driven northwards by both loops, the east loop goes round object 4 (north passage east, WORK,
south passage west) and the west loop round object 3 (north of it into the west part, past the
outbound dock from north to south, out through the gap between objects 2 and 3). Every way into
the west part is under 0.22 m wide, so both outbound lines are narrow lines, and they go on
through the passages round object 4: a robot plans its own way in the empty east part only."""
